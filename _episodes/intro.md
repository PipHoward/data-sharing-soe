    dissemination
  - There are many positive reasons to share data. Sharing data opens
    opportunities for scientific enquiry through the promotion of innovation via
    new data uses and collaboration. It maximises transparency and helps ensure
    the reliability of the scientific record.

Today we will be exploring the principles and practicalities of sharing research data. 
This will mean that the data we collect will be saved into a publicly-accessible repository.

*As open as possible, as closed as necessary*

Research data should be shared in line with the [FAIR sharing principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/):
* **F**indable
* **A**ccessible
  * Data should be saved on an accessible repository such as the [Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://osf.io/) or the [Bristol Research Data Repository](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/staff/researchers/data/publishing-research-data/), where we can give them a DOI
* **I**nteroperable
  * Data should be stored in formats that can be loaded by many different programs
* and **R**eusable
  * By giving our data an appropriate license, we will ensure people are clear about how the data can be used
  * By supplying meta-data (e.g., README, data dictionary) which explains the variables, we will make it possible for others to understand our dataset
