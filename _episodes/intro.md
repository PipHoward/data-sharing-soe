Today we will be exploring the practicalities and principles of sharing data.
This will mean that the data we collect will be saved into a publicly-accessible repository.
We will do our best to ensure that our data is in line with the [FAIR sharing principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/):
* **F**indable
  * The data will be saved on the [OSF](https://osf.io/), where we can give them a DOI
* **A**ccessible
  * We will access our data using the same public OSF interface as everyone else
* **I**nteroperable
  * We will save data in .csv format so that it can be loaded by many different programs
* and **R**eusable
  * By giving our data an appropriate license, we will ensure people are clear about how the data can be used
  * By supplying a data dictionary which explains the variables, we will make it possible for others to understand our dataset

#### Overview

There are many positive reasons to share data. Sharing data opens opportunities for scientific enquiry through the promotion of innovation via new data uses and collaboration.It maximises transparency and helps ensure the reliability of the scientific record.
