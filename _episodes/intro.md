exercises: null
questions:
  - What is data sharing?
  - Why is data sharing important?
objectives:
  - Understand what the workshop will contain.
  - "Identify reasons for sharing your research data. "
  - Identify and mitigate concerns about sharing data
keypoints:
  - Data sharing is the process of making research data available for wider
    dissemination
  - There are many positive reasons to share data. Sharing data opens
    opportunities for scientific enquiry through the promotion of innovation via
    new data uses and collaboration. It maximises transparency and helps ensure
    the reliability of the scientific record.
  - Generally, if you can share data, do.
  - Most concerns about sharing data can be resolved by careful planning and
    documentation

Today we will be exploring the principles and practicalities of [sharing research data](https://osf.io/wp4zu/). 

> ## Share data for the benefit of:
> * The research community
> * The research funders
> * The public
> * The researcher (you!)
{: .checklist}

> ## What could the data be used for?
> * **Reproducibility**: ensuring your data are consistent with the reported results.
> * **Reanalysis/Meta-analysis**: answering different questions to the ones already asked; answering the same question analysed in a different way; contributing to a wider understanding through integration with other similar data.
> * **Expanding Knowledge**: acting as a reference point to facilitate discussion and shared understandings; contributing to a body of observed facts that theories must account for; expand methodology assessment, recommendations and improvement; potentially improves connections to scientific network
> * **Teaching**: allowing learners to perform analysis on real data.
> * **Personal backup**: preserving access across computers and institutions.

> ## Value to the public
> * Shared data maximised the value of publicly funded research and reduces data duplication
> * Transparency can contribute to better-informed decision making e.g., policy, social choices, personal lifestyle and health

> ## Value to research funders
> * Data sharing is now often mandatory - funding bodies must maximize the value of research funds
> * Shared data can be used for verification of performance metrics and outcomes
> * Shared data enables the advancement of the current research and creates potential for new research - increased return on investment
> * Shared data reduces data duplication - reducing expenditure 

> ## Discussion: Who has shared data before? `5 min`
>   - What was the experience like?

> ## Discussion: concerns about sharing data `10 min`
