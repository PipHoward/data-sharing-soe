Research data should be shared in line with the [FAIR sharing principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/):
* **F**indable
* **A**ccessible
  * Data should be saved on an accessible repository such as the [Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://osf.io/) or the [Bristol Research Data Repository](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/staff/researchers/data/publishing-research-data/), where we can give them a DOI
* **I**nteroperable
  * Data should be stored in formats that can be loaded by many different programs
* and **R**eusable
  * By giving our data an appropriate license, we will ensure people are clear about how the data can be used
  * By supplying meta-data (e.g., README, data dictionary) which explains the variables, we will make it possible for others to understand our dataset

To achieve this you will need to consider:
File naming conventions
Meta-data - You will need to provide the maximum amount of information needed to recreate/reproduce this data
*README files
*Data dictionary
* Quality checks as you go along (e.g., is it sensible and readable to other people?)
