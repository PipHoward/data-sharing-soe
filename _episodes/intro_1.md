Research data should be shared in line with the [FAIR sharing principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/):
* **F**indable
* **A**ccessible
  * Data should be saved on an accessible repository such as the [Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://osf.io/) or the [Bristol Research Data Repository](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/staff/researchers/data/publishing-research-data/), where we can give them a DOI
* **I**nteroperable
  * Data should be stored in formats that can be loaded by many different programs
* and **R**eusable
  * By giving our data an appropriate license, we will ensure people are clear about how the data can be used
  * By supplying meta-data (e.g., README, data dictionary) which explains the variables, we will make it possible for others to understand our dataset

To achieve this you will need to consider:
File naming conventions
Meta-data - You will need to provide the maximum amount of information needed to recreate/reproduce this data
*README files
*Data dictionary
* Quality checks as you go along (e.g., is it sensible and readable to other people?)

## Anonymisation

Anonymisation is the process of turning data from which individual people can be identified into data from which individual people cannot be identified.

Pseudonymisation is the process of turning data from which individual people can be identified into data from which individual people can only be identified using other, non-shared information.

## Discussion
> Think of some recent data you have worked with. What would you need to do to implement the FAIR principles?
