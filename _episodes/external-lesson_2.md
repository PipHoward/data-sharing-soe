## What data should be shared

The Digital Curation Centre (DCC) has a wealth of expert guidance on data sharing and curation. 
They are responsible for the widely-used [DMPonline data management plan form](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/).

In this lesson, we will discuss a condensed form of the [DCC guide on deciding what data to keep](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/how-guides/five-steps-decide-what-data-keep). 

> ## What data should be shared?
> * **Relevance**: are the data relevant to reported results?
> * **Quality**: is the data sufficiently complete, coherent, valid, etc. to be useful?
> * **Metadata**: can we provide enough information about what the data are, how they were collected, etc?
> * **Demand/appeal**: will the data be of use to specific people? Will the data contribute to existing resources that are of use? Do the data support published research?
> * **Uniqueness**: can the data be easily reproduced (e.g. random numbers from a seeded generator)
{: .checklist}

> ## What policies apply?
> * **Journal policies**
> * **Institutional policies**
> * **Funder policies**
> * **Government policies**, which may include security classification and freedom of information policies.
> * **Contract/patent rules**
> * **Use for legal/public/police enquiries**
> * **Personal data rules (GDPR)**
> * **Ethics and consent**
{: .checklist}

> ## Discussion `10 min`
> Which of the policies and considerations above are relevant to your research?
> 
> Does your institution have a data sharing policy? 
> 
> Do other considerations or policies apply to your research not mentioned here?

## Attaining consent to share

Inform participants about what data will be stored, how it will be preserved, how it is likely to be used in the long-term, and how confidential it will be protected. The UK Data Service has a bank of example sharing-friendly forms for different types of data. 

Ensure consent forms do not promise to destroy the data or promise that the data will only be seen or accessed by the research team

[Example wordings](https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/manage-data/legal-ethical/consent-data-sharing/consent-forms.aspx)

> ## Costs of sharing
> * **Curation**: getting the data in an open format; adding metadata and creating a data dictionary.
> * **Storage**: housing in a repository and keeping available.

> ## Discussion `5 min`
> 
> Are they time/money costs? 
> 
> Will they pay off in the long run? 
> 
> Might they benefit you even if you didn't share? 
>
> Are there other costs that apply to sharing your data?
