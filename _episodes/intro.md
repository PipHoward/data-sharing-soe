> ## What could the data be used for?
> * **Reproducibility**: ensuring your data are consistent with the reported results.
> * **Reanalysis/Meta-analysis**: answering different questions to the ones already asked; answering the same question analysed in a different way; contributing to a wider understanding through integration with other similar data.
> * **Common example**: acting as a reference point to facilitate discussion and shared understandings; contributing to a body of observed facts that theories must account for.
> * **Teaching**: allowing learners to perform analysis on real data.
> * **Personal backup**: preserving access across computers and institutions.
