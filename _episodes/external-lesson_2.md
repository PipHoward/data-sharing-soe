## What data should be shared

The Digital Curation Centre (DCC) has a wealth of expert guidance on data sharing and curation: [DCC guide on deciding what data to keep](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/how-guides/five-steps-decide-what-data-keep). 

> ## What data should be shared?
> * **"as open as possible, as closed as necessary"**
> * **Relevance**: are the data relevant to reported results?
> * **Quality**: is the data sufficiently complete, coherent, valid, etc. to be useful?
> * **Metadata**: can we provide enough information about what the data are, how they were collected, etc?
> * **Demand/appeal**: will the data be of use to specific people? Will the data contribute to existing resources that are of use? Do the data support published research?
> * **Uniqueness**: can the data be easily reproduced (e.g. random numbers from a seeded generator)

> ## What policies apply?
> * **Journal policies**
> * **Institutional policies**
> * **Funder policies**
> * **Government policies**, which may include security classification and freedom of information policies.
> * **Contract/patent rules**
> * **Use for legal/public/police enquiries**
> * **Personal data rules (GDPR)**
> * **Ethics and consent**

## Attaining consent to share
>
>Inform participants about what data will be stored, how it will be preserved, how it is likely to be used in the long-term, and how confidential it will be protected. The UK Data Service has a bank of example sharing-friendly forms for different types of data. Ensure consent forms do not promise to destroy the data or promise that the data will only be seen or accessed by the research team
> * [UK Data Service guidance on seeking participant consent to share data](https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/manage-data/legal-ethical/consent-data-sharing.aspx)
> * [UK Data Service example consent form clause wording](https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/manage-data/legal-ethical/consent-data-sharing/consent-forms.aspx)
> * [Bristol examples and information on good consent form clause wording](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/staff/researchers/data/dealing-with-sensitive-data/) - getting permission for data sharing written into consent forms BEFORE the start of study is essential to being able to share data at the end.

## Data management plans
Data management plans are extremely useful and advised to help you make plans about your data, at all stages of the research process (this is often usually required with funding applications). Data management plans involve describing any research data youintend to create, how this data will be stored during the lifetime of a project and how valuable data will be shared after the project has ended.
> > ## Resources
> > * The DCC are responsible for the widely-used [DMPonline data management plan form](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/).
> > * [Bristol guidance on writing a data managemen plan](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/staff/researchers/data/writing-a-data-management-plan/)

> ## Costs of sharing
> * **Curation**: getting the data in an open format; adding metadata and creating a data dictionary.
> * **Storage**: housing in a repository and keeping available.

> Do other considerations or policies apply to your research not mentioned here?
