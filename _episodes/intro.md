questions:
  - What is data sharing?
  - Why is data sharing important?

  - Understand what the workshop will contain.
  - Understand how to access resources, ask for help, and give feedback.
  - "Identify reasons for sharing your research data. "
  - Identify and mitigate concerns about sharing data
keypoints:
  - Data sharing is the process of making research data available for wider
    dissemination
  - There are many positive reasons to share data. Sharing data opens
    opportunities for scientific enquiry through the promotion of innovation via
    new data uses and collaboration. It maximises transparency and helps ensure
    the reliability of the scientific record.
  - Generally, if you can share data, do.

> ## What could the data be used for?
> * **Reproducibility**: ensuring your data are consistent with the reported results.
> * **Reanalysis/Meta-analysis**: answering different questions to the ones already asked; answering the same question analysed in a different way; contributing to a wider understanding through integration with other similar data.
> * **Common example**: acting as a reference point to facilitate discussion and shared understandings; contributing to a body of observed facts that theories must account for; expand methodology assessment, recommendations and improvement
> * **Teaching**: allowing learners to perform analysis on real data.
> * **Personal backup**: preserving access across computers and institutions.
